🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily Python practice as a beginner.
I am learning Python step by step and uploading my progress here regularly to build strong programming fundamentals.

📌 Topics Covered (Day 1 & Day 2)

🔹 Introduction to Python  
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It is easy to learn and widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.

🔹 Variables  
Variables are used to store data in memory.
In Python, data types do not need to be declared explicitly.

Example:
name = "Fakiha"
age = 18

🔹 Comments  
Comments are used to explain code.
They are ignored by the Python interpreter.

Example:
# This is a single-line comment

🔹 Data Types  
Common data types in Python:

int    → whole numbers  
float  → decimal numbers  
str    → text  
bool   → True / False  
None   → represents no value  

Example:
x = 10  
y = 3.5  
name = "Hi"  
is_python = True  

🔹 type() Function  
The type() function is used to check the data type of a variable.

Example:
a = 5  
print(type(a))

🔹 Typecasting  
Typecasting means converting one data type into another.

Example:
a = "10"  
b = int(a)  
print(b)

🔹 input() Function  
The input() function is used to take input from the user.
Input is always taken as a string, so typecasting is often required.

Example:
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
print(num)

🔹 Operators  
Operators are used to perform operations on variables.

Arithmetic Operators:
+, -, *, /, %

Comparison Operators:
==, >, <

Logical Operators:
and, or, not

Example:
a = 10  
b = 5  
print(a > b and b < 10)

🔹 Truth Table (Logical Operators)

A     B     A and B     A or B     not A  
True  True  True        True       False  
True  False False       True       False  
False True  False       True       True  
False False False       False      True  

🔹 What is a Module?  
A module is a file that contains Python code.
It helps in reusing code.

Example:
import math  
print(math.sqrt(16))

🔹 What is PIP?  
PIP stands for Python Installer Package.
It is used to install external Python libraries.

Example:
pip install requests

🧪 Programs Practiced
- Add two numbers entered by the user
- Find remainder when a number is divided by z
- Check the type of variables
- Compare two numbers using comparison operators
- Find the average of two numbers
- Calculate the square of a number

🚀 Goal
- Learn Python from basics to advanced
- Practice daily
- Improve problem-solving skills

✨ This repository will be updated regularly as I learn more Python concepts.
