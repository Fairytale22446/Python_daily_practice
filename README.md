# 🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository contains my **daily Python practice as a beginner**.  
I am learning Python step by step and uploading my progress here regularly to build strong programming fundamentals.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered (Day 1 & Day 2)

### 🔹 Introduction to Python
Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language**.  
It is easy to learn and widely used in **web development, data science, AI, automation, and scripting**.

---

### 🔹 Variables
Variables are used to store data in memory.  
In Python, we do **not need to declare the data type explicitly**.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Fakiha"
age = 18
🔹 Comments
Comments are used to explain code and improve readability.
They are ignored by the Python interpreter.

Example:

python
Copy code
# This is a single-line comment
🔹 Data Types
Common data types in Python:

int → whole numbers

float → decimal numbers

str → text

bool → True / False

NoneType → None

Example:

python
Copy code
x = 10
y = 3.5
name = "Hi"
is_python = True
🔹 type() Function
The type() function is used to check the data type of a variable.

Example:

python
Copy code
a = 5
print(type(a))
🔹 Typecasting
Typecasting means converting one data type into another.

Example:

python
Copy code
a = "10"
b = int(a)
print(b)
🔹 input() Function
The input() function is used to take input from the user.
By default, input is stored as a string.

Example:


num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(num)
🔹 Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables.

Types of Operators:
Arithmetic operators → +, -, *, /, %

Comparison operators → ==, >, <

Logical operators → and, or, not

Example:


a = 10
b = 5
print(a > b and b < 10)
🔹 Truth Table (Logical Operators)
A	B	A and B	A or B	not A
True	True	True	True	False
True	False	False	True	False
False	True	False	True	True
False	False	False	False	True

🔹 What is a Module?
A module is a file that contains Python code.
It helps in code reusability.

Example:


import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
🔹 What is PIP?
PIP stands for Python Installer Package.
It is used to install external Python libraries.

Example:

pip install requests
🧪 Programs Practiced
Add two numbers entered by the user

Find remainder when a number is divided by z

Check the type of variables using type()

Compare two numbers using comparison operators

Find the average of two numbers

Calculate the square of a number

🚀 Goal
Learn Python from basics to advanced

Practice daily

Build consistency

Improve problem-solving skills

✨ This repository will be updated regularly as I learn more Python concepts.
