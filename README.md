# 🐍 Python Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily Python practice as a beginner.
I am learning Python step by step and uploading my progress here regularly.

## 📌 Topics Covered (Day 1 & Day 2)

### 🔹 Introduction to Python
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
- It is easy to learn and widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation.

---

### 🔹 Variables
- Variables are used to store data in memory.
- In Python, we do not need to define the data type explicitly.

Example:
```python
name = "Fakiha"
age = 18
🔹 Comments
Comments are used to explain code.

They are ignored by the Python interpreter.

Types of comments:

python
Copy code
# This is a single-line comment
🔹 Data Types
Common data types in Python:

int → whole numbers

float → decimal numbers

str → text

bool → True / False

Example:

python
Copy code
x = 10        # int
y = 3.5       # float
name = "Hi"   # string
is_python = True  # boolean
🔹 Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables.

Types of operators:

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)

Comparison operators (==, >, <)

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Example:

python
Copy code
a = 10
b = 5
print(a > b and b < 10)
🔹 What is a Module?
A module is a file that contains Python code.

It helps us reuse code.

Example:

python
Copy code
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
🔹 What is PIP?
PIP stands for Python Installer Package.

It is used to install external Python libraries.

Example:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
🚀 Goal
Learn Python from basics to advanced

Practice daily

Build consistency and improve problem-solving skills

✨ This repository will be updated regularly as I learn more Python concepts.
